    <h2>Background Info (schooling)</h2>
    <p>Hey there, I'm Divyesh Nagesh, and I'm rocking the 8th grade over at CTHS. I'm 13 years old and totally loving
      school right now. You know what subjects have me pumped? Computing skills, English, and math â€“ they're just
      awesome. And let me tell you about my favorite teachers this year, they're like superheroes in the classroom. Ms.
      Gray is the English guru who makes reading and writing feel like an adventure. Then there's Ms. Porecca, the science
      whiz who makes every class feel like a journey of discovery. And last but not least, Mr. Finlayson, the tech master
      who's helping me conquer the world of technology. With these amazing teachers!
    </p>
    <p>Also, my favorite subjects are Maths, English, and Computing Skills. I'm having a blast at school!</p>

    <h2>Where I'm from?</h2>
    <p>I came into this world on April 12, 2010, in the vibrant and diverse land of Australia. Specifically, I was born in
      the picturesque state of New South Wales (NSW), within the bustling city of Sydney. This dynamic and cosmopolitan
      region has been my home from the very beginning, shaping my experiences and adding a unique flavor to my journey
      through life. Born and raised in this captivating corner of the world, I've been fortunate to be a part of the lively
      culture and rich heritage that Sydney and NSW have to offer.</p>
